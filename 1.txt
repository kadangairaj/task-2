HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP
 connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.








                                            Here is a blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript:

Objects are one of the core data structures in JavaScript. They are used to store data and functions together as a single unit. Objects are created using curly braces and contain properties and methods. Properties are variables that belong to the object, and methods are functions that can be called on the object.
Objects are a very powerful data structure in JavaScript, and they are used in almost every JavaScript program. They are also very flexible, and they can be used to represent a wide variety of data.
The internal representation of objects in JavaScript is a bit complex, but it is important to understand how they work in order to write efficient JavaScript code.
Objects are stored in memory as a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. The key is the property name, and the value is the property value.
The hash table is implemented as a JavaScript object. The object's properties are the keys, and the object's values are the values. The hash table is also linked together using a linked list. The linked list is used to keep track of the order of the properties in the object.
When you create a new object, JavaScript creates a new hash table and a new linked list. The hash table is empty, and the linked list is empty.
When you add a property to an object, JavaScript adds the property to the hash table and the linked list. The property is added to the linked list at the end of the list.
When you get a property from an object, JavaScript looks up the property in the hash table. If the property is in the hash table, JavaScript returns the property value. If the property is not in the hash table, JavaScript returns undefined.
When you delete a property from an object, JavaScript removes the property from the hash table and the linked list. The property is removed from the linked list at the beginning of the list.

A MAC address is assigned to the network interface card by the manufacturer and is used for communication within the local area network. It is a globally unique address.
 An IP address is used for communication within the local area network and for communication between networks (usually through the Internet).
